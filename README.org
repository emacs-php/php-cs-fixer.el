* Emacs wrapper for PHP-CS-Fixer
  This package intergates PHP Coding Standards Fixer into Emacs.

  *NOTICE*: This package is in development and lacks testing, so use with caution.
  Improvements or ideas are welcome.

** Installation

   You need to have PHP-CS-Fixer (https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) installed

   If it is in your path, it should be detected automatically.

*** configuration with use-package
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package php-cs-fixer :ensure nil
   :load-path "~/src/php-cs-fixer.el"
   :config (setq php-cs-fixer--enable nil)) ;; disable it globally if you plan to enable it per folder
#+END_SRC

*** fix style on save

    With a buffer-local hook :
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'php-mode-hook
            (lambda () (add-hook 'before-save-hook #'php-cs-fixer--fix nil 'local)))
#+END_SRC

In case you setup a ~before-save-hook~, you might want
to tune ~php-cs-fixer--enable~ to control on which projects it runs.

** Usage

Run ~php-cs-fixer--fix~ to fix code style for the current buffer. In
case a .php_cs or .php_cs.dist file is found in the project root (as
guessed by php-project), it will be used.
